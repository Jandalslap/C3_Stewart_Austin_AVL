# This assignment was to create an AVLTree data structure that could accept a file of words and store them as key value pairs with the word and the word length as properties.

# Written in C# using Visual Studio, we were required to develop a menu system to test functions such as Insert, Find, Delete and Print.

# Using Timestamp I recorded the time taken to perform the above functions and plot them on a graph to explore the average case time complexities.
